# educational-data-mining-student-performance
Educational Data Mining project focused on predicting student academic performance using machine learning techniques and experimental analysis.

# Problem Description
Educational institutions generate large volumes of student-related data, including academic scores, attendance records, assessment results, and learning activity logs. Despite the availability of this data, traditional evaluation methods rely primarily on manual analysis and end-semester results, which limits the ability to identify students who may be at risk of poor academic performance at an early stage.
Teachers and academic administrators often face challenges in analyzing complex patterns across multiple factors that influence student learning outcomes. As a result, academic difficulties are usually identified only after final evaluations, when timely intervention is no longer possible.
This project addresses this challenge by applying Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques and machine learning models to analyze educational datasets and predict student performance in advance. The goal is to enable early identification of at-risk students and support data-driven academic decision-making, thereby improving learning outcomes and reducing failure and dropout rates.
